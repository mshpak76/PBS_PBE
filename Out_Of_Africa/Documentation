These script simulate a demographic history consistent with the parameter estimates in Gutenkunst et al (2009) for Eurasian
"out of Africa" migrations.

The slim scripts simulate local sweeps in focal population B (Europe) as well as parallel sweeps in all three populations
(Africa, Europe, China). The python script "recapitation" simulates the linked neutral demographic history at the same
locus using pyslim - with equivalent code for single and multiple sweeps apart from the names of input files.

The MSPrime python script simulates the neutral evolutionary history at loci other than those under the selective sweep.
This code samples from a random distriubtion of B multipliers for effective population size Ne to simulate the effects
of background selection (BGS) in reducing neutral genetic diversity at these loci.
